# DevOps tools for Azure

## Presentation

I'd like to share the tools I'm using for Azure in seperate directories.

- Ansible
- Terraform
- To be completed...

There are services that I also use and actions I need to make to use these services. You can get a brief overview about these actions.

- Azure Vault
- To be completed...

### Brief note on Azure Vault

You can create a Vault with the following command:

    az keyvault create --name "az-keyvault-name" --resource-group "your_rg_group" --location "westeurope"
